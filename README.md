# PlaylistBot
Creates playlists from songs posted in a discord server


Start bot in command prompt by navigating master directory and executing $nodemon --inspect index.js

Upon executing for the first time, you will most likely need to install several modules to get it working.
- MAKE SURE YOU ARE IN THE MASTER FOLDER
- Make sure you have node.js installed (node -v)
- Make sure you have npm installed (npm -v)
- Any missing modules listed hereafter can be installed by doing $npm install <module name>
- (TODO: make script that can install all needed modules automatically)


Will not work without secret key filled in
